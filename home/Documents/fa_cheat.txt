 On the Desktop
After following our desktop get started steps, you can copy any icon's name here and paste it into a text field and let ligatures do the rest of the work (when supported by your desktop app). Or you can also copy and paste the icon (not the unicode) directly from this page into a text layer.

 In Code
After following our SVG with JS or Web Fonts with CSS steps, you can copy any icon's name here and paste it into our standard markup. Using CSS pseudo-elements? Copy and paste the unicode value into your specific CSS rule.

Regular Icons in Font Awesome Free?
In order to make upgrading from Font Awesome 4 to 5 smoother for existing projects, we've bundled regular style icons that better match the previous versions appearance in free.

Something missing?
Not finding an icon or is there some way we can make the cheatsheet better at cheating or sheeting? Let us know!
